# Getting Started with Create React App and Python Flask framework to create The Tzedaka Tracker
This project offers a way we can track charity given. A user can enter the amount they wish to give and to which person or organization to give it to.  It offers an ability to use AI to find relevant organizations that fit the interest of the user. It also shows the history and can filter by date and/or organization.

# Technologies

For the front end we used React and Flask for the backend communicating via api calls. We used a MySQL Database. 

# To start the program: 
Backend: 
To run the backend please see the requirements.txt and install via pip all the python packages. Then run the manage.py to run all relevant scrips. 

Front End:

For the front end please run npm i and then npm start.

Sql: 

run the attached sql file with starter data in mysql.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
